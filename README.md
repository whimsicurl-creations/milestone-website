# Portfolio Website

### Overview
This is my personal portfolio site, created as a multi-page, responsive site.  I am a Web Designer currently searching for a full-time position with a small to medium-sized company.  My portfolio focuses primarily on my design work while also having a page dedicated to my web development projects.  I used both flexbox and grid to create layouts that would adjust well regardless of the screen size visitors viewed the site on.

### Features
This site was designed using:
 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - JavaScript
 - Flexbox
 - CSS Grid
